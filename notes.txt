Why Go?
    Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
            - No access modifiers
            - No classes (only structs)
            - No inheritence (only composition)
            - No reference types (everything is a value)
            - No exceptions (only errors)
            - No "try catch finally"
            - No pointer arithmetic
            - No implicit type conversion
            - No function overloading
    
    Lightweight
        Close to hardware
        No VM
        Efficient Concurrency Model

    Performance
        Close to hardware
        Equivalent to C++

    Concurrency
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            go keyword, channel (data type), channel operator ( <- ), range keyword, "select case" construct
        - Standard Library
            "sync" package
            "sync/atomic" package
