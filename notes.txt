Why Go?
    Simplicity
        ONLY 25 keywords
            - No access modifiers
            - No classes (only structs)
            - No inheritence (only composition)
            - No reference types (everything is a value)
            - No exceptions (only errors)
            - No "try catch finally"
            - No pointer arithmetic
            - No implicit type conversion
            - No function overloading
    
    Lightweight
        Close to hardware
        No VM
        Efficient Concurrency Model

    Performance
        Close to hardware
        Equivalent to C++

    Concurrency
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            go keyword, channel (data type), channel operator ( <- ), range keyword, "select case" construct
        - Standard Library
            "sync" package
            "sync/atomic" package

To run a program
    go run <filename.go>

To create a build
    go build <filename.go>
    go build -o <binary_filename> <filename.go>

To list all the environment variables
    go env

To list specific environment variables
    go env <var_1> <var_2> .....

To change the environment variables
    go env -w <var_1=val_1> <var_2=val_2>

Environment variables for cross compilation
    GOARCH
    GOOS

To get the list of supported platforms
    go tool dist list

To cross compile
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <filename.go>

Data Types
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 [ real(float32) + imaginary(float32) ]
    complex128[ real(float64) + imaginary(float64) ]

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32) (unicode code point)

Variables
    Function Scope
        := can be used
        Cannot have unused variables
        

    Package Scope
        := cannot be used
        Can have unused variables

Constants
    CAN have unused constants at function scope & package scope

Constructs
    if else
    switch case
    for
    func

Functions
    - Variadic functions
    - Anonymous functions
    - Higher Order Functions (Functions as first class objects)
        * Assign functions as values to variables
        * Pass functions are arguments
        * Return functions as return results
    
Errors
    values
    implements "error" interface
    Not "thrown" but returned
    
    Creation:
        errors.New()
        fmt.Errorf()
        etc

Collection
    Array
        Fixed length typed collection

    Slice
        Varying length typed collection

    Map
        varying length typed collection of key/value pairs

Modularization
    Modules
        Any code that is versioned, packaged & deployed together
    Packages
        Internal organization of a module

    Before Go 1.13 (No Modules)
        $GOPATH
            \bin
                Go binaries
            \pkg
                source code for 3rd party dependencies
            \src
                \github.com
                    \tkmagesh
                        \my-app (package)
                            import "github.com/tkmagesh/my-app/db"
                            \db
                            \utils
                        \my-app-2

    In Go1.13, Modules were introduced
    ~\09-modularity
        go.mod 
            module-name
                (https://github.com/tkmagesh/ibm-go-jan-2023/09-modularity)
            go version
            dependencies (optional)

    To create a module
        go mod init <module_name>

    To run a module
        go run .
    
    To create a build of a module
        go build .
        go build -o <binary_filename> .
                            
    To download a 3rd party module/package
        go get <module_name>
        ex:
            go get github.com/fatih/color
        
        (Note: By default, the dependencies code is downloaded to GOPATH/pkg folder)

    To update the go.mod file (sync the package usage)
        go mod tidy

    To download the dependencies of a module
        go mod download

    To localize the dependencies
        go mod vendor

    To refer to the module cache
        go run -mod=mod .
        go build -mod=mod .
    
    To install a go module as an executable binary (GOPATH/bin folder)
        go install <module_name>


    Other useful commands
        go mod graph
        go mod why <module>

Interface
    In Go, interfaces are "IMPLICITLY" implemented
    
Concurrency
    Ability to have more than one execution path
